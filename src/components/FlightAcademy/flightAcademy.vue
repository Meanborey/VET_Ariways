        <div class="py-3">
        <p>An ATO is an Approved Training Organisation. They are approved to deliver flight training by a 'competent authority'. These competent authorities set strict rules and standards that training providers are examined against.</p>
        <p>A flight school only receives approval if they are deemed to adhere to these regulations, which include but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc py-1 pl-5 ">
            <li>The safety and standard of training being delivered</li>
            <li>The standard of learning material being provided</li>
            <li>The safety and standard of aircraft/simulators the training is being delivered on</li>
            <li>Gaining approval as an ATO is a time consuming and expensive process for the training provider. It is the highest level of approval a training provider can receive</li>
            <li>Once approved, an ATO is approved to deliver training towards licences that will be issued by the competent authority which issued their approval</li>
        </ul>
