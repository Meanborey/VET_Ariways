                    <p class="py-3">The Private Pilot Licence for Aeroplanes is your aircraft driver’s licence. Typically referred to as the PPL or PPL(A), it is the first step in every professional pilot’s path to the skies.</p>
                    <p >The private pilot licence is the course that any leisure pilot or someone flying their own business trips needs. It is your licence to fly for fun. No special skills, knowledge or physical fitness are required to become a private pilot—the medical requirements are similar to those for getting a driver’s licence.</p>
                    <p class="py-3">We will teach you from the very basics to the final skill test, both in theoretical knowledge and practical flight training. We train all our customers to the same standards, whether their final goal is professional or leisure flying. Your first licence will allow you to fly single-engine aircraft in fair weather according to visual flight rules (VFR)—also at night if you choose to do the short Night Flying (NF) add-on—to take on passengers, and to fly abroad.</p>
                    <!-- <p class="">The VET Airways Cadet ab initio ATPL programme is a full training package with everything you need and is tailored to suit you as an individual learner. The training will be tailored to your availability, personal skills, knowledge and experience.</p>
                    <p class="py-5">Our professional pilot training is of premium quality with instruction given by experienced professional instructors on modern glass-cockpit aircraft.</p>
                    <p class="">Our professional flight instructors and state-of-the-art fleet ensure superior training for the best aviators. From your very first training flight our programme will prepare you for the demands of the modern glass cockpit environment. The target duration typically ranges from 12 to 24 months depending on your prior qualifications and the targeted pace that will be agreed upon individually. If you start from scratch without any aviation background or knowledge, 18 months is a good target duration. Individual progression varies. The maximum allowed duration is 36 months.</p> -->

                    <h1 class="text-base font-semibold">THEORETICAL TRAINING</h1>
                    <p>Theoretical studies are carried out as distance learning with online tools and e-books. You read up on the written material at home before attending classroom instruction (ground school) for a total of approximately four full days, spread evenly so that you can focus on a few topics at a time.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Independent studying does not mean you will be alone! Our instructors will be with you from the beginning to the end, answering your questions and helping you at distance and also following your progress. The on-site classroom tuition (ground school) gives you the chance to brush up on any difficult subjects and ask questions face-to-face; if you prefer, even these ground schools can be attended remotely by video and VR!</p>

                </div>
                <div>
                    <h1 class="text-base font-semibold">MEDICAL FITNESS</h1>
                    <p>As a rule of thumb, if you are fit for a driver’s licence, then you are most probably fit for flying. Before the solo phase of your practical flight training, ie. flying alone without an instructor, you do need to get a Class 2 medical certificate.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>You do not need a medical certificate in order to sign up for our courses or to start your theoretical studies; we will guide you through the process in person. However, if you have a doubt about your medical fitness or would just otherwise like to make sure you get it before starting any training, we recommend visiting an aeromedical examiner first — ask us for the contact details!</p>
