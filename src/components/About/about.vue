            <p class="py-5">We at VET Airways are passionate about providing you with the best customer service, be it excellent aerial adventure 
                flights, flight training or selling outstanding aircraft. As a school our aim is to be the number one flight school
                in South East Asia in terms of quality and safety. Our promise to you is to provide superior quality in customer 
                service, training, equipment and personnel.</p>
            <div>
                <span class="text-xl text-ellipsis ">Professional and Talented Instructors</span>
                <p class="py-5">Our instructors have hundreds, if not thousands of hours of experience as instructors and most have airline or charter 
                    flight experience. They are with us because they find instructing rewarding and are passionate about quality — not just 
                    to clock up more flight hours. That said, the quality of instructing does not rest on individual instructor’s shoulders, 
                    but is nurtured by our methodical approach to quality in our organisation and learning.
                </p>
                <span class="text-xl text-ellipsis py-5">Quality in Training</span>
                <p class="py-5">
                    We have a highly pedagogic approach to training. We are not here to show off our flying skills or experience, but to 
                    train our students to be safe and confident pilots, whether their flying objectives are professional or for leisure. 
                    We have taken a fresh approach with a training and quality system not seen in any other flight school before. Our 
                    teaching methods are tried and tested world-class systems, which we have adapted and further improved upon for the local 
                    environment — and they fully comply and exceed Cambodian and European aviation regulations.
                </p>
                <span class="text-xl text-ellipsis">Modern Training Aircrafts</span>
                <p class="py-5">Our training aircraft are state-of-the-art, perfect for training and have an extremely good safety record (in fact, the 
                    best in the industry.) We dare claim to operate the newest and most modern training fleet in our price category. Our 
                    students get to train on glass cockpit aircraft, but we also do teach on traditional instruments, not to forget that 
                    there’s still a large base of legacy cockpits out there.
                </p>
                <span class="text-xl text-ellipsis">New Aircrafts</span>
                <p class="py-5">As the Ellipse and Oxai Exclusive distributor for South East Asia, we not only sell new aircraft but also are keen on 
                    ensuring customers buying aircraft get the full support in terms of maintenance and training.
                </p>
