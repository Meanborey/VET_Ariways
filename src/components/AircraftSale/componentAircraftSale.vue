                    <p>We are familiar with and have helped our clients with different structures for organizing the ownership, e.g.:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Limited Liability Company</li>
                        <li>Leasing on a yearly or monthly basis</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Many clients prefer to set up a limited liability company as the plane’s owner, with client(s) owning its shares for reasons relating to manageability, taxes, and liabilities, especially if there are multiple owners involved, in addition to the obvious aspect of getting rental revenue via the company.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Initial limited company setup and registration (with shareholders’ agreement if multiple owners).</li>
                        <li>Recurrent statutory administration (ordinary meetings, bookkeeping, end of year statements, tax filings).</li>
                        <li>Extraordinary meetings as required.</li>
                        <li>Facilitating the selling and buying of shares.</li>

                    <p>If, after a while of owning, you start feeling like your aircraft could fly more than what you use it yourself alone, we can help you get rental returns from your investment. We can help you to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rent your aircraft to our users by the hour.</li>
                        <li>Provide renters the necessary differences training to your aircraft and recurrent checks, as may be required.</li>
                        <li>Manage the online reservation calendar as well as reservation requests by phone to VET Airways’ Dispatcher.</li>
                        <li>Provide the briefing, technical preparation and other facilities to renters for a smooth rental experience.</li>
                        <li>Collect the payments from the individual renters to be further paid to your account once a month.</li>
                        <li>Observe the accumulation of hours and report those, along with technical defects, to your airworthiness organization in order to schedule maintenance
                            And ultimately, when you think the time has come to cede the controls of your aircraft for good, we can help you get the best price for it in the pre-owned market by a brokerage arrangement.</li>
